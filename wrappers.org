#+TITLE: Bookmark Wrapper Loader
#+AUTHOR: octo
#+LANGUAGE: en

* Purpose
This script provides a shell function =b= that uses the =bookmarker= CLI tool
to quickly jump to bookmarked directories.

* Bash and Zsh
Bash-compatible wrapper must be written in POSIX shell syntax.
To load it into your shell session:

#+begin_quote
source bookmarker_wrapper.sh
#+end_quote

This adds the =b= function to your environment, allowing:
#+begin_quote
b key   # runs `bookmarker quick key` and cd's to the result
#+end_quote

* Fish Shell
Fish has its own syntax and cannot source POSIX scripts directly.

To load the wrapper:

#+begin_quote
source bookmarker_wrapper.fish
#+end_quote

This defines a =b= function using Fish syntax.

* Why separate files?
Fish is not POSIX-compliant. It cannot =source= shell scripts like Bash or Zsh.
Each shell needs its own syntax-compatible wrapper.
